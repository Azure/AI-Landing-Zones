## Governance

| ID   | Specification |
|------|--------------|
| G-R1 | **Enforce built-in policies**: <ul><li>The AI Landing Zone MUST implement and continuously enforce built‑in AI-related Azure Policies and provide opinionated guidance for their operationalization.</li><li>Reference: <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/governance/policy/samples/built-in-policies">Built-in Azure Policies</a></li><li><strong>Implementation Guidance:</strong><ul><li>Automate assignment of curated initiatives at management group scope.</li><li>Baseline set includes initiatives for <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/policy-reference?context=%2Fazure%2Fai-studio%2Fcontext%2Fcontext">Azure AI Foundry</a>, <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/policy-reference">Azure Machine Learning</a>, <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/policy-reference">Azure AI services</a>, <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/search/policy-reference">Azure AI Search</a> and others.</li><li>The deployment process MUST select appropriate <em>Workload Specific Compliance</em> initiatives (e.g., <a href="https://www.azadvertizer.net/azpolicyinitiativesadvertizer/Enforce-Guardrails-OpenAI.html">Azure OpenAI</a>, <a href="https://www.azadvertizer.net/azpolicyinitiativesadvertizer/Enforce-Guardrails-MachineLearning.html">Azure Machine Learning</a>).</li><li>Apply an audit-&gt;deny lifecycle (start with audit, switch to deny once non‑compliance &lt;5%).</li><li>Map relevant <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/governance/policy/samples/#regulatory-compliance">regulatory compliance initiatives</a> to workloads that handle regulated data.</li></ul></li></ul> |
| G-R2 | **Adopt industry standards**: Provide prescriptive mapping guidance from platform controls to [NIST AI RMF](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/ai/NIST.AI.100-1.pdf) core functions and use the [NIST AI RMF Playbook](https://airc.nist.gov/AI_RMF_Knowledge_Base/Playbook) to evidence control coverage. Maintain a control matrix in source control (MUST be updated with each material architectural change). |
| G-R3 | **Operationalize Responsible AI**: Implement mandatory evaluation pipeline using [Responsible AI dashboard](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/concept-responsible-ai-dashboard); gate production promotion on passing safety & fairness thresholds defined by risk classification. Store evaluation artifacts for audit (minimum 6 months). |
| G-R4 | **Content safety enforcement**: Integrate [Azure AI Content Safety](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/content-safety/overview) as a REQUIRED pre and post-inference control path for high-risk workloads (public chat, user-generated content). Maintain baseline severity thresholds and review monthly; changes require security approval. |
| G-R5 | **Model allowlist governance**: Use Azure Policy to enforce a model allowlist. Phase 1: Audit new model deployments; Phase 2: Deny non-approved models; Phase 3: Automated notification & remediation workflow for unauthorized existing deployments (documented runbook). |
| G-R6 | **Service Groups (preview) integration**: AUTOMATE registration of core AI resources (hubs/projects, AML workspaces, APIM, vector stores, Key Vaults) into defined Service Groups (ai-core, ai-security, ai-network). Provide script & pipeline task; rollback plan is documented in a manual query. |
| G-R7 | **Cross‑region governance enforcement**: REQUIRE mirrored policy assignments, RBAC role mappings, tagging schema, and diagnostic settings in every active AI region. Central dashboard MUST highlight drift (region missing initiative/diag setting). |
| G-R8 | **Time‑boxed policy waivers**: Implement waiver workflow (issue template + owner + expiry + compensating control). Dashboard MUST surface active waivers & auto‑notify owner 7 days before expiry. No open‑ended waivers allowed. |
| G-R9 | **Data residency control**: Maintain residency decision checklist (data categories, encryption, replication scope). Sensitive embeddings MUST NOT replicate cross‑sovereign boundaries without documented DSR (data sharing request) approval. Reference the Sovereign Landing Zone pattern when applicable. |
