| G-R1 | **Align with built-in policies**: The AI Landing Zone should provide guidance and implantation of built-in AI related policies, and the implementation must comply with those policies.<br><br><https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/governance/policy/samples/built-in-policies><br><br>Best Practice<br><br>Automate policy enforcement with Azure Policy to enforce policies automatically across AI deployments, reducing human error. The AI Landing Zone must adhere to recommended Azure Policies for AI resources. Apply AI policies to each management group. Start with baseline policies for each workload type, such as those policies used in [Azure landing zones](https://github.com/Azure/Enterprise-Scale/wiki/ALZ-Policies). Use Azure Policy to apply built-in policy definitions for each AI platform you're using. It includes [Azure AI Foundry](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/policy-reference?context=%2Fazure%2Fai-studio%2Fcontext%2Fcontext), [Azure Machine Learning](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/policy-reference), [Azure AI services](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/policy-reference), [Azure AI Search](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/search/policy-reference), and others. For Azure landing zone users, the [deployment](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/ready/landing-zone/implementation-options#environment-development-approaches) includes a curated set of recommended built-in policies for Azure AI platform services. Select the policy initiative you want to use under the _Workload Specific Compliance_ category during an Azure landing zone deployment. The policies sets include [Azure OpenAI](https://www.azadvertizer.net/azpolicyinitiativesadvertizer/Enforce-Guardrails-OpenAI.html), [Azure Machine Learning](https://www.azadvertizer.net/azpolicyinitiativesadvertizer/Enforce-Guardrails-MachineLearning.html), and [Azure AI Search](https://www.azadvertizer.net/azpolicyinitiativesadvertizer/Enforce-Guardrails-CognitiveServices.html), and [Azure Bot services](https://www.azadvertizer.net/azpolicyinitiativesadvertizer/Enforce-Guardrails-BotService.html). Use the applicable [regulatory compliance initiatives](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/governance/policy/samples/#regulatory-compliance) in Azure Policy for your industry. |
| G-R2 | **Industry Standards**: The AI Landing Zone should provide guidance on how to align and comply with industry standard guidance such as the [NIST Artificial Intelligence Risk Management Framework (AI RMF)](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/ai/NIST.AI.100-1.pdf) and [NIST AI RMF Playbook](https://airc.nist.gov/AI_RMF_Knowledge_Base/Playbook) |
| G-R3 | **Responsible AI**: The AI Landing Zone should provide guidance and implementation of [responsible AI standards](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/scenarios/ai/govern#assess-ai-organizational-risks) using the [Responsible AI dashboard](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/concept-responsible-ai-dashboard) to generate reports around model outputs. |
| G-R4 | **AI Content Safety**: The AI Landing Zone should provide guidance and implementation of [Azure AI Content Safety](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/content-safety/overview) APIs that can be called for testing to facilitate content safety testing.<br><br>Best Practice<br><br>Use [Azure AI Content Safety](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/content-safety/overview) to define a baseline content filter for your approved AI models. This safety system runs both the prompt and completion for your model through a group of classification models. These classification models detect and help prevent the output of harmful content across a range of categories. Content Safety provides features like prompt shields, groundedness detection, and protected material text detection. It scans images and text. Create a process for application teams to communicate different governance needs. |
| G-R5 | **Model Availability:** The AI Landing zone should provide guidance and implementation to govern model availability.<br><br>Best Practice<br><br>Use Azure Policy to manage which specific models your teams are allowed to deploy from the Azure AI Foundry model catalog. You have the option to use a [built-in policy](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-studio/how-to/built-in-policy-model-deployment) or create a custom policy. Since this approach uses an allowlist, begin with an _audit_ effect. The _audit_ effect allows you to monitor the models your teams are using without restricting deployments. Only switch to the _deny_ effect once you understand the AI development and experimentation needs of workload teams, so you don't hinder their progress unnecessarily. If you switch a policy to _deny_, it doesn't automatically remove noncompliant models that teams have already deployed. You must remediate those models manually. |
