|  C-R1 | **Standardize compute**: Provide implementation of Azure Container Apps as a primary compute option while guiding other compute options.<br><br>Best Practice:<br><br>Compute underpins agent orchestration services, evaluation/batch jobs, and model fine‑tuning. Azure Machine Learning offers compute instances, clusters, and serverless options. Standardize: approved SKUs, runtimes (Python version, base images), auto-shutdown for dev, and GPU allocation criteria. For service-specific options, see [Azure AI Foundry](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-studio/how-to/create-manage-compute) and [Machine Learning](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/how-to-create-attach-compute-studio).|
