|  C-R1 | **Standardize compute**: The AI Landing zone must provide implementation of Azure Container Apps as a compute option while providing guidance on the other compute options.<br><br>Best Practice:<br><br> You need compute resources for certain actions like prompt flows and training models. A service like Machine Learning has different compute options, such as compute instances, clusters, and serverless options. Standardize the compute type, runtimes, and shutdown periods. For service-specific compute options, see [Azure AI Foundry](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-studio/how-to/create-manage-compute) and [Machine Learning](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/how-to-create-attach-compute-studio).|
