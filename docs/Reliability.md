|  R-R1  | **Multi Region Disaster Recovery**: The AI Landing zone should provide AI endpoints in at least two regions to provide redundancy and ensure high availability.<br><br>Best Practice:<br><br> Establish a policy for business continuity and disaster recovery for your AI endpoints and AI data. Configure baseline disaster recovery for resources that host your AI model endpoints. These resources include [Azure AI Foundry](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-studio/how-to/disaster-recovery), [Azure Machine Learning](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/how-to-high-availability-machine-learning), [Azure OpenAI](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/openai/how-to/business-continuity-disaster-recovery), or Azure AI services. All Azure data stores, such as [Azure Blob Storage](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/common/storage-disaster-recovery-guidance), [Azure Cosmos DB](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cosmos-db/online-backup-and-restore), and [Azure SQL Database](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-sql/accelerated-database-recovery), provide reliability and disaster recovery guidance that you should follow. Implement multi-region deployments to ensure high availability and resiliency for both generative and nongenerative AI systems For more information, see multi-region deployment in [Azure AI Foundry](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-studio/how-to/disaster-recovery#plan-for-multi-regional-deployment), [Azure Machine Learning](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/how-to-high-availability-machine-learning#plan-for-multi-regional-deployment), and [Azure OpenAI](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/openai/how-to/business-continuity-disaster-recovery).|
|  R-R2  | **APRL:** The AI Landing Zone should align with the service and workload level recommendations from APRL [Artificial Intelligence (GPT-RAG)](https://azure.github.io/Azure-Proactive-Resiliency-Library-v2/azure-specialized-workloads/ai/) and [Azure Resources.](https://azure.github.io/Azure-Proactive-Resiliency-Library-v2/azure-resources/)|
