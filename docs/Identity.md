## Identity

Identity requirements and best practices.

| ID   | Specification |
|------|--------------|
| I-R1 | **Managed identities everywhere:** Implement managed identities with least privilege on all supported services.<br><br><strong>Best practice:</strong> Use [managed identity](https://learn.microsoft.com/entra/identity/managed-identities-azure-resources/overview) for service-to-service auth. Avoid stored secrets. Scope role assignments minimally (resource group / resource). |
| I-R2 | **MFA and PIM for privileged access:** Enforce MFA and just-in-time elevation for sensitive roles.<br><br><strong>Best practice:</strong> Enable [multifactor authentication](https://learn.microsoft.com/entra/identity/authentication/tutorial-enable-azure-mfa) and [Microsoft Entra Privileged Identity Management](https://learn.microsoft.com/entra/id-governance/privileged-identity-management/pim-configure). Use Azure Bastion for secure jump access; restrict control plane exposure. |
| I-R3 | **Microsoft Entra ID over static keys:** Prefer Entra tokens for all AI service access.<br><br><strong>Best practice:</strong> Replace static API keys with Entra-based auth. Audit remaining key usage quarterly. See guidance for [Azure AI Foundry](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/ai-studio/concepts/rbac-ai-studio), [Azure OpenAI](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/ai-services/openai/how-to/managed-identity), [Azure AI services](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/ai-services/authentication), [Azure Machine Learning](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/machine-learning/how-to-setup-authentication). |
| I-R4 | **Conditional Access policies:** Enforce risk-based adaptive controls.<br><br><strong>Best practice:</strong> Apply [risk-based Conditional Access](https://learn.microsoft.com/entra/id-protection/howto-identity-protection-configure-risk-policies) requiring compliant devices, trusted locations, and MFA for critical operations. |
| I-R5 | **Least privilege RBAC:** Define and review access baselines.<br><br><strong>Best practice:</strong> Map roles to personas. Use scoped built-in roles; avoid Owner. Review assignments quarterly. Assign: (1) Azure AI User (development) (2) Azure AI Project Manager (project configuration). |
| I-R6 | **Disable key-based access:** Enforce Entra-only access to model endpoints.<br><br><strong>Best practice:</strong> Require Entra auth for inference; disable local keys where supported. Monitor for unauthorized key re-enablement. |
