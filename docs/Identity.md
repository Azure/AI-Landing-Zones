## Identity

| ID    | Specification |
|-------|--------------|
| I-R1  | The AI Landing Zone must provide implementation of managed identities with least privilege access. <br><br>Best Practice:<br><br> Use [managed identity](https://learn.microsoft.com/entra/identity/managed-identities-azure-resources/overview) on all supported Azure services. Grant least privilege access to application resources that need to access AI model endpoints. Secure Azure service-to-service interactions. Use managed identity to allow Azure services to authenticate to each other without managing credentials.|
| I-R2  | The AI Landing Zone must provide guidance on leveraging MFA and PIM for sensitive accounts.<br><br>Best Practice:<br><br> Enable [multifactor authentication](https://learn.microsoft.com/entra/identity/authentication/tutorial-enable-azure-mfa) (MFA) and prefer secondary administrative accounts or just-in-time access with [Privileged Identity Management](https://learn.microsoft.com/entra/id-governance/privileged-identity-management/pim-configure) (PIM) for sensitive accounts. Limit control plane access using services like Azure Bastion as secure entry points into private networks. |
| I-R3  | **Use Microsoft Entra ID for authentication**: The AI Landing Zone must provide guidance on leveraging MFA and PIM for sensitive accounts. <br><br>Best Practice:<br><br> Wherever possible, eliminate static API keys in favor of Microsoft Entra ID for authentication. This step enhances security through centralized identity management and reduces secret management overhead. Also limit the distribution of API keys. Instead, prefer identities in Microsoft Entra ID over API keys for authentication. Audit the list of individuals with API key access to ensure it's current. For authentication guidance, see [Azure AI Foundry](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/ai-studio/concepts/rbac-ai-studio), [Azure OpenAI](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/ai-services/openai/how-to/managed-identity), [Azure AI services](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/ai-services/authentication), [Azure Machine Learning](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/machine-learning/how-to-setup-authentication). |
| I-R4  | **Use Conditional Access policies**: The AI Landing Zone must provide guidance on leveraging Conditional Access policies. <br><br>Best Practice:<br><br> Implement [risk-based Conditional Access policies](https://learn.microsoft.com/entra/id-protection/howto-identity-protection-configure-risk-policies) that respond to unusual sign-in activity or suspicious behavior. Use signals like user location, device state, and sign-in behavior to trigger extra verification steps. Require MFA for accessing critical AI resources to enhance security. Restrict access to AI infrastructure based on geographic locations or trusted IP ranges. Ensure that only compliant devices (those meeting security requirements) can access AI resources. |
| I-R5  | **Configure least privilege access:** The AI Landing Zone must provide implementation and guidance on how to configure least privilege access. Configure least privilege access by implementing role-based access control (RBAC) to provide minimal access to data and services. Assign roles to users and groups based on their responsibilities. Use Azure RBAC to fine-tune access control for specific resources such as virtual machines and storage accounts. Ensure users have only the minimum level of access necessary to perform their tasks. Regularly review and adjust permissions to prevent privilege creep. <br><br>1.  Assign Azure AI User to develop with this project. <br> 2.  Assign Azure AI Project Manager to develop and manage project settings. |
| I-R6  | The AI Landing Zone must provide implementation and guidance on how to disable key based access and only have access to AI Model endpoints using Microsoft Entra ID.<br><br>Best Practice:<br><br> Secure external access to AI model endpoints. Require clients to authenticate using Microsoft Entra ID when accessing AI model endpoints. |
