## Resource Organization

| ID   | Specification |
|------|--------------|
| R-R1 | **Region Selection**: The AI Landing Zone must provide guidance on how to select regions based on the combination of regional availability of Azure Services and their configuration.<br><br>Best Practice:<br><br>Before deployment, ensure that there's [availability in the region](https://azure.microsoft.com/explore/global-infrastructure/products-by-region/#products-by-region_tab5) for the AI resources that you need. Certain regions might not provide specific AI services or might have limited features, which can affect the functionality of your solution. This limitation can also affect the scalability of your deployment. For example, Azure OpenAI service availability can vary based on your deployment model. These deployment models include global standard, global provisioned, regional standard, and regional provisioned. Check the AI service to confirm that you have access to the necessary resources.<ul><li>To capture and use completions data, you will need to make sure your resource region is included in: swedencentral, northcentralus, eastus2</li><li>Azure OpenAI Evaluation is only supported in the following regions: [eastus2, northcentralus, swedencentral, switzerlandwest, uaenorth], and your region is eastus. Change to a valid region to use Azure OpenAI Evaluation.</li><li>Real-time audio is only available in the following regions: eastus2swedencentral</li><li>Assistants are only available in the following regions: australiaeast, centraluseuap, eastus, eastus2, francecentral, japaneast, norwayeast, southindia, swedencentral, uksouth, westus, westus3</li></ul> |
| R-R2 | **Quota**: The AI Landing Zone must provide guidance on the quota required to deploy the resources.<br><br>Best Practice:<br><br>Consider the quota or subscription limits in your chosen region as your AI workloads grow. Azure services have regional subscription limits. These limits can affect large-scale AI model deployments, such as large inference workloads. To prevent disruptions, contact Azure support in advance if you foresee a need for extra capacity. |
| R-R3 | **Limits**: The AI Landing Zone should provide guidance on Azure subscription and region quota limits based on [Azureâ€™s subscription quota limitations](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/azure-resource-manager/management/azure-subscription-service-limits) to avoid unexpected service disruptions. |
| R-R4 | **AI Foundry Resource & Projects**: Provide guidance and implementation of multi-project deployment anchored to an Azure AI Foundry resource.<br><br>Best Practice:<br><br>Azure AI Foundry uses a resource + projects model. Projects segment artifacts (connections, agents, deployments) for teams / environments while sharing governed backing services (Search, Cosmos, Storage) when appropriate. Align project boundaries to environment (dev/test/prod) or product domain, not both-avoid explosion of low-value projects. Use separate subscription for strict billing isolation when cost center autonomy is required. Reference [Manage AI deployments](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/scenarios/ai/manage#manage-ai-deployment). |

| R-R5 | **Migration (Legacy Hub to Current Model)**: Provide guidance to migrate from earlier "hub & project" terminology / constructs to the current Foundry resource + projects approach.<br><br>Best Practice:<br><br>Inventory existing hubs & projects, map each to target Foundry resource. Recreate project-scoped connections & deployments via IaC (export parameters). Validate role assignments & private networking parity. Decommission legacy hub only after verifying evaluation & deployment parity. Communicate naming changes to downstream automation (CI variables, dashboards). |

| R-R6 | **Portal Employee Visibility Limitation**: Document limitation around visibility of Azure employees (portal) in Foundry projects for transparency & governance.<br><br>Best Practice:<br><br>Classify workspace/project data sensitivity. For highly regulated workloads, restrict portal usage-prefer infrastructure as code + automated deployment; monitor audit logs for external principal access. Maintain an exception register for any required portal actions (troubleshooting). |
