## Resource organization

| ID   | Specification |
|------|--------------|
| R-R1 | **Region selection:** Provide guidance to select regions based on service availability and configuration.<br><br><strong>Best practice:</strong> Check [regional availability](https://azure.microsoft.com/explore/global-infrastructure/products-by-region/#products-by-region_tab5) for required AI resources. Document region-dependent capabilities (evaluation, real-time audio, assistants) and update as Azure publishes changes. |
| R-R2 | **Quota:** Provide guidance on required quotas for resource deployment.<br><br><strong>Best practice:</strong> Track regional subscription limits. For large-scale inference, request increases early to avoid disruption. |
| R-R3 | **Limits:** Document subscription and regional quota limits per [Azure limits](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/azure-resource-manager/management/azure-subscription-service-limits) to avoid disruption. |
| R-R4 | **AI Foundry resource & projects:** Provide guidance for multi-project deployment anchored to a single Azure AI Foundry resource.<br><br><strong>Best practice:</strong> Segment by environment or product domain (not both). Share governed backing services where appropriate. Use separate subscriptions for strict billing isolation. Reference [manage AI deployment](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/scenarios/ai/manage#manage-ai-deployment). |
| R-R5 | **Migration (legacy hub to current model):** Guidance to migrate from earlier hub & project constructs to current resource + projects approach.<br><br><strong>Best practice:</strong> Inventory existing hubs/projects, map to target resource, recreate connections via IaC, validate RBAC & private networking, then decommission legacy hubs. Communicate naming changes to downstream automation. |
| R-R6 | **Portal employee visibility limitation:** Document visibility of Azure employees (portal) in projects for transparency & governance.<br><br><strong>Best practice:</strong> Classify data sensitivity. For regulated workloads, restrict portal usage-prefer IaC and automation; monitor audit logs for external principal access. Maintain an exception register for required manual portal actions. |
