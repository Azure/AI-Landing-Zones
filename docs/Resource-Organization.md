## Resource Organization

| ID   | Specification |
|------|--------------|
| R-R1 | **Region Selection**: The AI Landing Zone must provide guidance on how to select regions based on the combination of regional availability of Azure Services and their configuration.<br><br>Best Practice:<br><br>Before deployment, ensure that there's [availability in the region](https://azure.microsoft.com/explore/global-infrastructure/products-by-region/#products-by-region_tab5) for the AI resources that you need. Certain regions might not provide specific AI services or might have limited features, which can affect the functionality of your solution. This limitation can also affect the scalability of your deployment. For example, Azure OpenAI service availability can vary based on your deployment model. These deployment models include global standard, global provisioned, regional standard, and regional provisioned. Check the AI service to confirm that you have access to the necessary resources.<ul><li>To capture and use completions data, you will need to make sure your resource region is included in: swedencentral, northcentralus, eastus2</li><li>Azure OpenAI Evaluation is only supported in the following regions: [eastus2, northcentralus, swedencentral, switzerlandwest, uaenorth], and your region is eastus. Change to a valid region to use Azure OpenAI Evaluation.</li><li>Real-time audio is only available in the following regions: eastus2swedencentral</li><li>Assistants are only available in the following regions: australiaeast, centraluseuap, eastus, eastus2, francecentral, japaneast, norwayeast, southindia, swedencentral, uksouth, westus, westus3</li></ul> |
| R-R2 | **Quota**: The AI Landing Zone must provide guidance on the quota required to deploy the resources.<br><br>Best Practice:<br><br>Consider the quota or subscription limits in your chosen region as your AI workloads grow. Azure services have regional subscription limits. These limits can affect large-scale AI model deployments, such as large inference workloads. To prevent disruptions, contact Azure support in advance if you foresee a need for extra capacity. |
| R-R3 | **Limits**: The AI Landing Zone should provide guidance on Azure subscription and region quota limits based on [Azureâ€™s subscription quota limitations](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/management/azure-subscription-service-limits) to avoid unexpected service disruptions. |
| R-R4 | **AI Foundry Accounts & Project**: The AI Landing Zone must provide guidance and implementation of multi-account and multi-project deployment.<br><br>Best Practice:<br><br>Azure offers tools like Azure AI Foundry [hubs and projects](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-studio/concepts/ai-resources) to enforce governance and security. Azure Machine Learning has similar capabilities with its [hub workspaces](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/concept-hub-workspace). Use a hub per billing boundary to allocate costs across different teams. For more information, see [Manage AI deployments](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/scenarios/ai/manage#manage-ai-deployment). Use distinct workspaces to organize and manage AI artifacts like datasets, models, and experiments. Workspaces centralize resource management and simplify access control. For example, use [projects](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-studio/concepts/ai-resources#organize-work-in-projects-for-customization) within Azure AI Foundry to manage resources and permissions efficiently, facilitating collaboration while maintaining security boundaries. |
