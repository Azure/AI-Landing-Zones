## N|  N-R1  | |  N-R8  | **Firewall**: The AI Landing Zone must provide guidance & implementation of a UDR to Azure or 3P Firewall.<br><br>**Best Practice:**<br><br> [Azure Firewall](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/firewall/overview) enforces security policies for outgoing traffic before it reaches the internet. Use it to control and monitor outgoing traffic and enable SNAT to conceal internal IP addresses by translating private IPs to the firewall's public IP. It ensures secure and identifiable outbound traffic for better monitoring and security. |
|  N-R9  | **Private DNS Zones**: The AI Landing Zone should provide guidance and implementation of [integrated private endpoints with Private DNS Zones](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/private-link/private-endpoint-dns-integration) for proper DNS resolution and successful private endpoint functionality. In case of platform landing zone, the central Private DNS Zones will be leveraged instead.<br><br>**Best Practice:**<br><br> Private DNS zones centralize and secure DNS management for accessing PaaS services within your AI network. Set up Azure policies that enforce private DNS zones and require private endpoints to ensure secure, internal DNS resolutions. If you don't have central Private DNS Zones, the DNS forwarding doesn't work until you add conditional forwarding manually. For example, see [using custom DNS](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/how-to-custom-dns) with Azure AI Foundry hubs and Azure Machine Learning workspace. Custom DNS servers manage PaaS connectivity within the network, bypassing public DNS. Configure private DNS zones in Azure to resolve PaaS service names securely and route all traffic through private networking channels. |

For minimizing data exfiltration risks, restricting outbound traffic to approved services or fully qualified domain names (FQDNs) and maintain a list of trusted sources. You should only allow unrestricted internet outbound traffic if you need access to public machine learning resources but regularly monitor and update your systems.

In case of existing platform landing zone the central jump box and bastion service should be used instead.<br><br>**Best Practice:**<br><br> AI development access should use a jumpbox within the virtual network of the workload or through a connectivity hub virtual network. Use Azure Bastion to securely connect to virtual machines interacting with AI services. Azure Bastion provides secure RDP/SSH connectivity without exposing VMs to the public internet. Enable Azure Bastion to ensure encrypted session data and protect access through TLS-based RDP/SSH connections. |
