# AI Landing Zone Bill of Materials (BoM)

The AI Landing Zone Service Inventory is a curated list of Azure services that form the architecture of the AI Landing Zone. It defines which services are deployed by default, which are feature-flagged, and how they align across Bicep, Terraform, and Portal implementations. This inventory ensures consistency, feature parity, and modularity across deployment options, supporting both generative and non-generative AI workloads.
